Wired has <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgets/wireless/magazine/16-02/ff_iphone?currentPage=1#">published</a> a very interesting article on how Steve Jobs and Apple created the iPhone.<br /><br /><p><br />While I'm on the subject, Steve Jobs also gave a very good convocation <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">address</a> at Stanford a few years back, which is an excellent read.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer">&nbsp;</div>
