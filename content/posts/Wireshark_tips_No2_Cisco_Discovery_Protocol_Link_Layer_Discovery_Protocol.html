<i>TShark 1.2.15, Oracle Enterprise Linux 6.5</i><br/><br/>

<p>
Ever wondered what switch or router port your server was plugged into? If your server is plugged into a Cisco switch or router, then chances are it is broadcasting Cisco Discovery Protocol packets periodically.  Other vendors use LLDP (ethertype 0x88cc). You can use tshark to  capture one of these packets on a physical server (CDP does not usually pass through to virtual machines) and determine what port you are plugged into.
</p>

<p>Note that Cisco ASA firewalls do not support CDP, so if your server is plugged into an ASA, this tip won't do you any good.  If you find yourself on a VMware ESXi server, it does not come with tshark installed; however, you can use the following command instead: <pre>vim-cmd hostsvc/net/query_networkhint</pre>
</p>

<p>
<pre>tshark -i eth0 -V -f "ether host 01:00:0c:cc:cc:cc or ether proto 0x88cc" -c 2
Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.
