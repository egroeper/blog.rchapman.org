<i>screen, TERM=xterm-256color</i><br /><br />I am using screen and when I changed my terminal type to xterm-256color, with <b>TERM=xterm-256color</b>, I found that when 256color2.pl was run, the system colors palette only showed 8 colors.  The bold versions were the same.<br /><br />After much searching on the ncurses message boards, I found this little gem:<br /><br /><b><pre>attrcolor b "I"   # use bright colors for bold</pre></b><br /><br />Put that in your .screenrc and you should be all set.<div class="blogger-post-footer">&nbsp;</div>
