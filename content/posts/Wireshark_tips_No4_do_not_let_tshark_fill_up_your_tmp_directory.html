<i>TShark 1.2.15, Oracle Enterprise Linux 6.5</i><br/><br/>

<p>
By default, tshark will write its capture data to the <tt>/tmp</tt> directory.  If you do not have a large <tt>/tmp</tt> and run tshark for a long period of time, you may find that <tt>/tmp</tt> gets filled up.
</p>

<p>To tell tshark to write to a different directory, set the <tt>TMPDIR</tt> environment variable before starting it.</p>

<p>
<pre>
env TMPDIR=/scratch/
</pre>
</p>
