<p><em>Ubuntu 14.04 (Linux 3.13.0-48), freeradius 2.1.12, ASA 9.4.2 (which runs Lua 5.0.2), AnyConnect 4.2</em><br/><br/></p>

<p>Setting up communications between an ASA and a radius server can be tricky, because it's hard to know what attributes the radius server is sending back and are being applied to a user session.  One method is to use wireshark to capture the communications between the ASA and radius server.  Another is to enable debugging on the ASA with <tt>debug dap trace</tt>. An easier way is to just have the attributes printed out on the end-user device when they log in.</p>

<p>The dynamic access policy feature of the ASA will let you input Lua functions to get this information. Open ASDM and go to
<ul>
<li>Configuration</li>
<li>Remote Access VPN</li>
<li>Network (Client) Access</li>
<li>Dynamic Access Policies</li>
<li>Click Add</li>
<li>Policy Name: debug</li>
<li>Priority: 1 (or whatever works in your environment)</li>
<li>In the Selection Criteria area, click Advanced</li>
<li>Make sure AND is selected.  In the Logical Expressions box, enter:
<pre>
assert(function()

  function print_table(tbl, prefix)
     if (type(tbl) == "table") then
       for k,v in pairs(tbl) do
         if (type(v) == "table") then
           print_table(v, prefix .. "." .. k)
         else
           CheckAndMsg(true, prefix .. "." .. k .. "=\"" .. v .. "\"", "")
         end
       end
     end
  end

  CheckAndMsg(true, "============", "")
  CheckAndMsg(true, "DEBUG", "")
  print_table(aaa, "aaa")
  print_table(endpoint, "endpoint")

  return true

end)()
</pre>
</li>
<li>Click OK to close the Add Dynamic Access Policy window, then click Apply</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Now, if you log in to AnyConnect on a device, you'll notice that a dropdown message box appears and shows you the values of the AV pairs.

You might want to be able to toggle the display of the debug message from a freeradius server.  That will allow you to turn it on when a user calls in and reports problems and you need to know what settings are being applied to their account.

<ul>
<li>On the freeradius server, change their user record and add <tt>Reply-Message = "debug_print"</tt>.  Note that you could use any attribute you want, but I know that Reply-Message does work.
<pre>
test            Cleartext-Password := "test123"
                Class = "OU=Test_VPN;",
                Reply-Message = "debug_print"
</pre>
<li>Back in ASDM, go to the debug policy you created earlier and change it so that it only fires when <tt>Reply-Message = "debug_print"</tt>

<li>OK and Apply</li>
</ul>
</p>
